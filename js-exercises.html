<!-- Exercises:
1.Given a number between 0 and 6 representing the days of the week, print "Go to work." if it's a work day and "Sleep in." if it's a weekend day. You can set up an array for the days of the week, or for extra credit, you can check out the JS Date object here).

2. Given a month number, between 1 and 12, and a year, print the number of days in that month - accounting for leap years.

3. Given the amount of a bill as a number, and a level of service - which can be "good", "fair", or "bad", print the total bill with the tip included. The amount of tip given for each level of service is defined by:

"good" -> 20%
"fail" -> 15%
"bad"  -> 10%

Extra: Add to "Tip Calculator"...you are also given the number of people to divide the total into. Print the amount for each person to pay. -->
